# Flow

Unofficial Deezer client for Ubuntu Touch.

Enjoy your favorite music on Ubuntu Touch with Flow! Play Deezer Flows, playlists, and search for music, artists, and albums.

Flow runs a webview in the background and does not integrate with MediaHub. Loading when starting the app may take a while. To keep playback running when the app is not in focus, please disable background suspension using the UT Tweak Tool. On some devices, playback may stutter when the screen is off.

Note: Flow has only been tested with a premium Deezer account.
